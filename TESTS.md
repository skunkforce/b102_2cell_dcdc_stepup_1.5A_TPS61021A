# sanity check
## setup
Connect 2.4v between J1 pinns 1 (gnd) and 4 (+) with a current limmit of 100mA. Measure the current. After filling the capacitors on the board the current should drop to below 1mA.
## results
untested


# power test 33mA
## setup
Connect 2.4v between J1 pinns 1 (gnd) and 4 (+). Connect 100R between J3 pins 1 and 9 and measure the voltage drop over the resistor.
## results
untested

# power test 330mA
## setup
Connect 2.4v between J1 pinns 1 (gnd) and 4 (+). Connect 10R between J3 pins 1 and 9 and measure the voltage drop over the resistor.
## results
untested

# power test 1000mA
## setup
Connect 2.4v between J1 pinns 1 (gnd) and 4 (+). Connect 3.3R between J3 pins 1 and 9 and measure the voltage drop over the resistor.
## results
untested
